# The Mountain

A UNR CS 425 and 426 Senior Project

## NOTE FOR GRADING (Hey Vinh :)

The final, latest and greatest branch is called 'TheREALmain.' It only has a few commits on it that were done after final development, but it also has all the work that was done the night before Innovation Day that's not on the 'main' branch, we just weren't able to get that work documented in commits. The entirety of the project and the rest of the commits are on the 'main' branch.

## Unity Version Used

2021.2.7f1

## Abstract

The Mountain is an action-adventure 2D side scrolling PC video game that has a focus on platforming and exploration. The main goal is to scale a mountain by progressing through different environmental levels. During the development process, our team learned many new techniques related to Unity game development. These techniques, some of which include utilizing healthy Git practices, modularized object scripting, isolated scene development, and extensive prefab usage, all  helped us make a successful workflow for creating the features of The Mountain we strived for; features that include fluid character movement and combat mechanics, hand-drawn sprite art, tutorial dialogue boxes, HUD and menu elements, integrated sound effects, and parallax background scrolling.
